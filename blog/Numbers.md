# Numbers<br><br>

Hey there!<br><br>

So, Iâ€™ve taken the plunge and decided to get my own Polish teacher! It feels like the right step to help me get better and really dive into the language.<br><br>

We've been working on numbers lately, and let me tell you, my mouth is having a tough time! ðŸ˜‚ Itâ€™s a bit of a struggle to get the pronunciation just right. Some days, it feels like my tongue has a mind of its own!<br><br>

But Iâ€™m sticking with it! Learning numbers is super important, especially when you want to navigate daily life in Poland.<br><br>

Iâ€™ll keep you posted on my progress. Hereâ€™s to more language adventures! ðŸŽ‰
